# Detail work you've completed in Sprint 4

## Frontend:

## Backend:
We began the sprint by resolving an bug we had with our established register function. 

Later in this sprint, we created a table that would be able to store the calandar evenets of each user registered in our database. Along with this database, we created functions in our api to communicate with the front end and allow for users to add calandar items, delete calandar items, as well as fetch all calandar items for the requested user. 

Further, we created a friend table that could keep track of all user relations, including accepted friends, friend requests and blocked users. Along with this table, we created functions in our api to communicate with the front end and allow for the user to request to be friends with another user, allow a user to accept a firend request, and allow a user to block another. We also implemented a function that allows the client to request the friend status of a user, and recieve a list of all accepted friends, incoming friend requests and blocked friends. 

In order to create these tables and functions to communicate with the front end, we had to create new migration functions and new database functions to help us manage our database. Further, we added all of the tables we created for our backend database into our testing-only database so we would be able to run our unit tests. 

A good amount of time during this sprint was dedicated to connecting our front end with our backend and resolving issues involved in alligning these two parts of our project. Further, a lot of time went into creating meaningful unit tests for the new tables and functionality we added to our backend.
