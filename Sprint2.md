Sarah: I worked on setting up Cypress. Downloaded Cypress to the correct directory and created our first simple test. The test checks that the calendar page opens and has a certain URL. Next I will work on component testing using Cypress.
Alexa: Worked on creating login component to link front and back ends

Sarah: Worked on creating component unit tests using Angular Testing. I believe that I will be unit testing with Angular Testing then E2E testing using Cypress. Today I created a unit test to test the functionality of our sideNav toggling.

**List unit tests and Cypress tests for frontend**
#Cypress Tests
First simple Cypress test: Clicks calendar button on side nav and checks if the user is redirected to the calendar page. 

#Unit Tests
Sidenav: Toggles sidenav button to check if the first click opens the sidenav bar and the second click closes the sidenav bar.
Full-Calendar Component: 
    Weekend Toggler: Checks if the weekend toggle shows weekends when button is selected and removed weekends when the button is not selected.
