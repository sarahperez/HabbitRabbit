Sarah: I worked on setting up Cypress. Downloaded Cypress to the correct directory and created our first simple test. The test checks that the calendar page opens and has a certain URL. Next I will work on component testing using Cypress.
Alexa: Worked on creating login component to link front and back ends

Sarah: Worked on creating component unit tests using Angular Testing. I believe that I will be unit testing with Angular Testing then E2E testing using Cypress. Today I created a unit test to test the functionality of our sideNav toggling.
