**Setting Up Go**

Start by installing Go: https://go.dev
Since we are running our code in Visual Studio Code, we also installed this extension: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go#:~:text=Go%20in%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%20Using%20the%20Go,the%20Go%20extension%20from%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace.



**Database**

Our app implements a SQLite database. Before running the server, make sure to download and install the https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/ GCC compiler. We opted for the "Minimal online installer." We also downloaded the precompiled binary for our system from the SQLite website: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html (we downloaded the bundle option so we could check updates to the database using sqlite3 https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html). Make sure to unzip that download into a folder, and add the path to the folder to the Path environment vairiables on you system. Close VS code and re-open it.
