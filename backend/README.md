**Database**

Our app implements a SQLite database. Before running the server, make sure to download the correct precompiled binary for your system from the SQLite website: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html (we downloaded the bundle option so we could check updates to the database using sqlite3 https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html)

Make sure that you add the SQLite download to your Path environment vairiable.
