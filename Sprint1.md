User Story #1: Busy College Students
As a busy college student, I want a tool that combines all of my favorite 
productivity applications all in one so that I can save time jumping around to 
different productivity tools.

User Story #2: Hard time scheduling events with friends
As a social being, I thrive when spending time with those who are closest to me. Unfortunately,
I find that it is hard to schedule events where all of my friends would be able to attend. I wish there
were a tool that could find enpty space in my friend group's schedules so that we can find time 
to spend together.
